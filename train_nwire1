element	O

Finally	O
,	O
sprinkle	O
it	O
generously	O
with	O

what	O

with	O
health	O

his	O
back	O
has	O
never	O

One	O
way	O
to	O
change	O
that	O
is	O
by	O
playing	O

which	O
punishes	O
even	O

Can	O
Lemieux	B-PER
produce	O
at	O
a	O
high	O
level	O
at	O
age	O
35	O
?	O

Perhaps	O
,	O
although	O
crackdowns	O
on	O
obstruction	O
fouls	O
,	O
such	O
as	O

tend	O

This	O
helped	O
persuade	O

retire	O

with	O

the	O

this	O

you	O

From	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
made	O
the	O
prohibition	O
of	O

a	O
principal	O

It	O

a	O

that	O

prosecution	O

In	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
each	O
allegation	O
of	O

we	O
have	O
thoroughly	O
investigated	O
the	O

reminded	O

I	O
have	O
undertaken	O
an	O
investigation	O

determine	O
whether	O

my	O

someone	O

I	O
am	O
undertaking	O
this	O
investigation	O
with	O
deep	O
regret	O

because	O
I	O
know	O
how	O

it	O
is	O
to	O
a	O
staff	O
of	O
highly	O

Monica	B-PER
Lewinsky	I-PER

William	B-PER

has	O

The	O
``	O
leaks	O
''	O
that	O
you	O
complain	O
about	O
,	O
thus	O
,	O
may	O
have	O
come	O
from	O
sources	O
close	O
to	O
those	O
under	O
investigation	O

Those	O
sources	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
clear	O

manifest	O
motivation	O
to	O
release	O
harmful	O
information	O
with	O
carefully	O
crafted	O
defenses	O

your	O
role	O

your	O
loyalty	O

Fiercely	O

representation	O
